# Nar

*Nar* (eng. pomegranate) because I never manage to consume these as a whole...

Nar is a design pattern for working with partially initialized objects.
Think GraphQL, but much smaller in scope and at the same time more versatile.
Although this repository represents a Java library, there is nothing Java-specific
in Nar and it can be easily ported to any language that supports concepts like enums,
sets and interfaces with default methods (or any similar concept).
Also, it's [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) compatible, so it can be used
on both backend and frontend.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/gkresic/nar/wiki) for details, especially
[Motivation](https://github.com/gkresic/nar/wiki/Motivation) and
[Getting started](https://github.com/gkresic/nar/wiki/Getting_started).
